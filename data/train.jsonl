All labels are wrong. You pick one fruit from the box labeled 'Both'. It's an apple. What's in each box?", "thinking_cot": "Step 1: Understand the constraints. Step 2: Identify what makes this tricky. Step 3: Since all labels are wrong and we drew an apple from 'Both', that box must be 'Apples only'. The box labeled 'Apples' can't have apples, and the box labeled 'Oranges' can't have oranges. So 'Apples' label has oranges, and 'Oranges' label has both. Step 4: Verify the solution satisfies all constraints.", "answer": "The 'Both' box has only apples. The 'Oranges' box has both. The 'Apples' box has oranges.", "source": "synthetic"}
